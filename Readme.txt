Program: Sessions
Course:  CS646 - Spring
Name:    Shane Chapman

Funcionality:
The app is designed to be a session taker for patients.  The questions are static right now and built from a JSON file.
The overall goal is to have those questions pulled from an external service and be dynamic.  Every session taken is
stored in the database.  There is a default user that is installed - User: CS645 Pass: SP2014.  There is a register
user link to create new users.  The user can swipe left/right to navigate between questions.

Limitations:
There is no encryption with login
No checking for unique user names during registration
No input validation.  Inputs that require int will accept Strings
No intuitive way for the user to know that they can swipe to navigate questions


Styling:
The program needs to be branded
